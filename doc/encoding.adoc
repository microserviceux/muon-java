## Encoding Support

Muon uses a mix of encoding methods, depending on your configuration and the types that you use.

The default codec for internal types is now *Avro*, and it is recommended that you use Avro if you can, as this gives
an improved experience for integration with external tooling, as Muon can negotiate the sending of Avro schemas and provides
them to clients via the Introspection protocol.

There are three sources of Avro Schema information that Muon can use :-

* You generate a SpecificRecord extending class from an existing Schema, using the Avro tools.
* You load in a Converter type,
* For regular POJOS with no more information, Muon will auto create a schema from your Java type and send that. This does not include any validation rules, and auto generates the Schema types from the Java types, which may be incorrect. All fields are marked as Nullable

The fallback Codec is JSON, encoded using GSON.

For Muon implementations that don't support Avro, Muon will send JSON encoded messages and process the responses from JSON into Java types.

### Adding a new Converter type

By default, Avro expects you to generate classes using the Avro tools, which then extend SpecificData and have a built in conversion
system. This is the fastest mechanism for encoding, but is also the most invasive system.
