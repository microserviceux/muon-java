= Muon Java

Muon Java is the implementation of the Muon microservices toolkit for the Java platform. It enables the easy construction
of microservices that can communicate with other Muon compatible services.

== A Microservice based system in 5 minutes

The quickest way to start a new Muon Java Microservice is to use _Spring Boot_ and the _Spring CLI_.

You can install this by following the instructions at spring.io or using _SDK Man_

```
curl -s get.sdkman.io | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

sdk install springboot
```

You can then create a new Spring Boot based application as a Groovy script.

```
include::src/main/groovy/io/muoncore/example/Introduction.groovy[lines=5,6,18]
```
